bio: |
   Vasant Dhar is a Professor at the Stern School of Business and the Center for Data
   Science at NYU, and Editor-in- Chief of the Big Data journal. Dhar’s research and
   practice addresses the following question: when should we trust machines with
   decisions? His answers are based on many years of experience with building autonomous
   machine-learning- based predictive systems in domains including finance, healthcare,
   primary education and sports. Dhar writes regularly about machine learning and artificial
   intelligence in the media such as the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and
   Wired.
abstract: |
   As autonomous learning machines become a bigger part of our lives, we
   need a framework for evaluating which decisions we should be comfortable
   delegating to learning algorithms and which ones humans should retain. It is
   surprising that no such framework has existed, given the high stakes involved. I
   describe a risk-oriented framework for deciding when and how to allocate
   decision problems between humans and machine-based decision makers. The
   framework is based on the experiences that my collaborators and I have had
   implementing prediction systems over the last 25 years in domains like finance,
   healthcare, education, and sports. I also explore the different roles visualization
   can play in autonomous learning systems.
