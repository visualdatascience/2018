bio: |
  Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation,
  and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of
  Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make
  data science easier, faster, and more fun. His work includes packages
  for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr,
  purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2,
  testthat, devtools). He is also a writer, educator, and speaker
  promoting the use of R for data science.
abstract: |
   In this talk, I'll outline my vision of data science as a field,
   focusing on the corner in which I'm most familiar: designing tools
   for data scientist-programmers. I'll talk about why I believe
   programming is so important for data science, why code is an excellent
   medium of computation, and outline some of the challenges that visual
   tools face. I'll also talk about data science challenges where
   programming doesn't help or feels excessively clumsy, and speculate on
   how we might fuse the best of programmatic and interactive UIs.
